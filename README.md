# VP Investments - Alternative Signal Investment Research Platform

## üéØ Project Overview

VP Investments is a comprehensive investment research platform that combines alternative data sources (Reddit sentiment, Google Trends, news sentiment) with traditional financial metrics to identify emerging stock opportunities. The system focuses on detecting early momentum signals and validating them with fundamental and technical analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Philosophy
The platform operates on a multi-stage pipeline that:
1. **Discovers** signals from alternative data sources
2. **Validates** them with financial fundamentals
3. **Scores** and **ranks** opportunities using machine learning
4. **Reports** findings through Excel and web dashboards

### Data Flow

## üßπ Cleanup (optional)

Use the cleanup utility to remove caches, build artifacts, and obsolete files.

What it removes safely:
- Python caches: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`
- Web build folders: `web/vp-investments-web/.next/`, `web/vp-investments-web/node_modules/`
- Rotated logs: `outputs/logs/` and `*.log.*` (keeps `vp_investments.log`)
- Obsolete files: `Roadmap.txt`, `bug_checker.py`

Run on Windows PowerShell from the repo root:

```powershell
python .\tools\cleanup.py
```

## üìà Performance Metrics
## ü¶Ü DuckDB Quick Queries

```


The system tracks multiple performance indicators:
- **Signal Success Rate** - Percentage of profitable signals
- **Average Returns** - Mean performance across time windows
- **Sharpe Ratio** - Risk-adjusted performance
- **Maximum Drawdown** - Worst-case scenario analysis
- **Beat Benchmark Rate** - Outperformance vs. SPY
