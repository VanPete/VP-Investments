Here’s a quick status of the 1–16 roadmap (updated 2025-08-18, post-commit) and the next concrete actions.

1) Database foundation — Done
- Runs, prices, features, labels, signals_norm, experiments, metrics in place.

2) Price ingestion — Improved
- Bulk yfinance + DB upserts and price backfill CLI in tools/price_backfill.py.
- Added gap diagnostics CSV and a simple retry/backoff queue for sparse tickers.

3) Run and signal persistence — Done
- Run rows + numeric feature snapshots persisted.
- Normalized signals table (signals_norm) with score, rank, trade_type, risk_level, and subscores persisted per run/ticker.

4) Label generation — Done
- Labels persisted during backtest; labels-only mode supported.
- tools/labels_backfill.py wrapper added for backfilling 1D/3D/7D/10D.

5) Backtest metrics & exports — Done (with new metrics)
- Deciles (gross/net), turnover, cost summary.
- Daily Spearman IC and precision@K computed and exported per-run and globally.

6) Trainable scoring profile — Improved
- Trainer supports optional rolling time-split CV with embargo; per-fold metrics persisted.
- Next: cross-sectional standardization audit and model comparison dashboard.

7) Experiment tracking — Done
- Experiments and metrics persisted for comparisons.

8) Scheduling and retention — Done
- Orchestrator supports scheduling toggles and added outputs retention sweep (keep last N runs via env).

9) Observability — Improved
- JSONL logs, counters, aggregated fetch reliability.
- Added an error budget target and per-component success-rate export to References/Error_Budgets.csv, plus persistence into metrics.
- Trend chart + table from metrics for last 30 days added (Error_Budget_Trend.csv + plot on dashboard).

10) API endpoints — Done
- Outputs and read-only DB endpoints: /api/db/{runs,metrics,labels,features} with caching and CORS.

11) Tests (additions) — Improved
- Added tests: price upsert dedupe/overwrite; label upsert idempotency; feature snapshot time integrity; label window correctness; weekly rollup smoke.
- All tests pass locally (11 passed).
- Added tiny synthetic E2E that runs enrich (labels-only) and trains via helpers.

12) Refactors — Partial
- IO isolation improved; labels centralized.
- Next: lightweight data contracts (pydantic/typed schemas) and flag cleanup.

13) Week-long proving plan — Done
- Weekly rollup implemented (processors/weekly_rollup.py), wired into orchestrator. Exports CSV and writes summary metrics.

14) Performance and reliability — Done
- WAL, indexes, batching, pacing/rate limiting.

15) Documentation — Partial
- README updated with DB schema overview, CLIs, weekly rollup, and observability/error budgets. Next: short dev guide and schema diagram.
 - Developer Guide added at docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md; Schema overview added at docs/SCHEMA.md.

16) Optional enhancements — Pending
- Drift/shift checks, SHAP/permutation importance, SeenCache→SQLite, global cache TTLs.
 
Immediate Next Steps
- Cross-sectional feature standardization audit: Done (feature_standardization_audit.csv + dashboard section).
- Model comparison export + dashboard table: Done (Model_Comparison.csv + dashboard table).
- Follow-up: add brief narrative in README/docs interpreting the standardization audit.
