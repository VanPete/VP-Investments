- Signal_Report.xlsx — main report with multiple sheets.
- References/ — CSV versions, correlations, legends, and clean extracts.
- References/Picks.csv — filtered candidates with stops and size guidance.

Quick tips:
- Picks.csv defaults to deciles 8–10, ADV >= $2M, excludes earnings within 3 days.
- Size @ $100k column uses 1% risk per trade and the suggested stop.
- Adjust filters later in code if your workflow differs.
